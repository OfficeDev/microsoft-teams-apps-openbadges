In education, more schools and colleges are issuing digital badges to help their students display verified and openly-referenceable skills, accomplishments, quality or interest  to employers or graduate programs.

Open Badges app will empower individuals to take their learning with them, wherever they go, building a rich picture of their lifelong learning journey by leveraging capabilities from the 3rd party digital badge issuing authority called Badgr.

Using the Open Badges app template in Microsoft teams, Users can create and award badges to team members right within the Teams' context. When a badge is awarded,  Recipients and other team members are notified about the awarded badge details in the channel by tagging them in a channel conversation. All the team members will be able to select badges from the list of available badges and award to one another, whereas only Team owners will be able to create new badges.
