In education sector, more schools and colleges are issuing digital badges to help their students display verified and openly-referenceable skills, accomplishments, quality or interests  to potential employers or graduate programs.

Additionally, organizations are also looking for customized, white-labeled offerings to motivate and spur employee morale through digital badges within Teams. Open badges allows these organizations to deliver such custom and branded experiences for their employees.

Open Badges app will empower individuals to take their learning with them, wherever they go, building a rich picture of their lifelong learning journey by leveraging capabilities from the 3rd party digital badge issuing authority called [Badgr](https://badgr.org/).


Using the Open Badges app template in Microsoft teams, Users can create and award badges to team members right within the Teams' context. When a badge is awarded,  recipients and other team members are notified about the awarded badge details in the channel by tagging them in a channel conversation. All the team members will be able to select badges from the list of available badges and award to one another, whereas only Team owners will be able to create new badges.

The awarded badges are recorded in the recipient's Badgr profile which is secure, portable and easily shareable.
